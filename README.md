Test Task for QCM
 
This repo contains all the codes and assests of the Task which We get as Web developer task to complete for Quizzers Club Manit. 

For this we have to replicate a webpage from a reference image, I tried to make the webpage responsive towards different screen sizes although nothing mentioned in the given task, i assumed the requirement and implemented that accordingly.

Buttons and links will not work except one, which leads user from signup page to sign-in page and vice versa. And other button are just for UI and have no functionality.
